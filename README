Android Noise Music Demo

Move balls around a screen and convert that into music!

Well this is a mix.

This is 1 part Java android project and 1 part perl and csound project. I've merged both.

See a demo of this in action! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjjZyB6gtGo

BTW 5balls.orc needs 5balls.wav, a mono 8000hz wave file of your choosing (music is good).
